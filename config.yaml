# CED
#
# Here you specify the parameters for gathering data from the CEBAF Element Database (CED)
#
#  history: Set true in order to query CED history instance, otherwis OPS instance is used
#  workspace: Workspace/Date to query.  Default is OPS/now
#  zone: The name of a CED zone
#
#  types: A list of types to retrieve. Can simply use BeamElem or LineElem and rely on CED inheritance.  Must
#         choose types that all have S and EPICSName property as well as any specified extra properties.
#         Not every retrieved type of element will necessarily be used.
#         Which elements will be used as graph nodes is determined in the nodes block of the config file.
#
#  properties: A list of properties to fetch in addition to default EPICSName and S which are hard-coded.
#              Any extra properties specified must be applicable to all retrieved types.
#
#  expressions: A list of CED property expressions. See CED command line help for details about available options.
#       Example: S >= 6.65657  # skip over elements in the front of the MFA0I03 S Value
#       Example: '!isSRF'      # Only retrieve elements whose is isSRF property is false or null
#
ced:
  history: true           # Optional.  Default is false meaning use OPS ced.
  workspace: '2021-12-15' # Optional.  Default is OPS workspace/current timestamp
  zone: "Injector"        # Required.  See https://ced.acc.jlab.org/zones/
  types: ["LineElem"]     # Required.  See https://ced.acc.jlab.org/catalog/
  properties: []          # Optional.  Specify properties in addition to default EPICSName and S
  expressions:
    - S >= 6.65657  # skip over elements in the front of the MFA0I03 S Value
    - S <= 101.58   # So that ILM0R08 is final element

# Nodes
#
# Here you specify information about the nodes that will be generated from the CED data.
#
# setpoints:  List CED types whose elements are to be considered setpoints and their desired EPICS fields
# readgacks:  List CED types whose elements are to be considered readbacks and their desired EPICS fields
#
# default_attributes:  Specify a label for node properties derived from the empty ("") EPICS field name
#
# modifiers:  Provide calculation expressions that will be used to manipulate data retrieved from the archiver.
#             This might be useful to normalize data taken from elements that record data at differeing scales.
#             To the left of the colon is the PV to be modified.  To the right is the expression with the PV
#             name included in EDM macro syntax $(PV)
#
# filter:    A filter expression to govern whether data for a given time interval is valid (i.e. was the beam on?).
#            Only time intervals for which the filter returns True will be written to output files.
#

    # Special handling for this case has been hard-coded into the node module.
    CryoCavity: ['PSET','GSET','XPSET8']

    # Because the types below will be matched in the order listed, we can provide
    # special PV list for the Capture and then let the catch-all WarmCavity
    # handle PreBuncher, Buncher, Chopper, etc.

    BCM: [""]                   # node module must handle special cases

    # Certain Ion Pumps in the injector need to be scaled differently based on their hardware type

# Mya
#
# Here you specify information that will govern fetching of data from the mya archiver.
#
# deployment:
#   Which mya deployment to use (history or ops).  Deployment "history" should suffice in most situations. It contains
#   data going back much further (~10 years) than the ops deployment (~2 years).  However the history
#   deployment only gets refreshed at the first of each month, so any more recent data must come from ops.
#
# throttle:
#   Sets the max number of data points to be fetched from the archiver web api in a single HTTP request.
#   The web server will timeout if a request takes too long to complete.
#
# dates:
#
#   ---IMPORTANT---
#   It is probably best practice leave the begin and end parameters blank here and specify them
#   on the command line instead.  That way the same config file can be used for multiple date ranges.
#   ---------------

#   begin: The start of the date range to fetch (YYYY-MM-DD [HH:MM:SS])
#   end: The end of the date range to fetch (YYYY-MM-DD [HH:MM:SS])
#   interval: An interval specifier ('1h' = 1 hour, '1d' = 1 day, etc.)
#   Example -
#     begin: "2021-01-01"
#     end: "2021-12-15"
#     interval: "1h"
#
#   -- OR --
#
# dates: "filename"
#   where filename contains either singe timestamp per line or a comma-separated begin,end,interval triplet per line
#   Example -
#     2021-01-01, 2021-02-01, 1h
#     2022-01-01, 2022-01-15, 1h
#     ...
#
# global:
#   A list of global signal names to be fetched at each time interval.  These values may be referenced as
#   variables in node.filter.

# Edges
#
# Here you specify information that will govern construction of edge features
#
#  connectivity: each readback node will be connected to to the intervening setpoint and readback nodes up until the nth
#                readback node, where n = edges.connectivity.
#  directed:  true if edges are considered unidirectional
#  weighted : if true, edges will be weighted using 1/(S[2]-S[1])

# Output
#
# Here you specify options that will govern output and its directory structure
#
# structure: tree (default) or directory
#            tree: output data sets in a year/month/day/hour/min/sec folder hierarchy
#            directory: output data sets beneath a single directory in folders named yyyymmdd_hhmmss
#
# minutes:  (tree only) if true then two digit minutes subdirectories will be created beneath hour
# seconds:  (tree only) if true, then two digit seconds subdirectories will be created beneath minutes

#           Note: if seconds is true, then minutes will automatically also be regarded as true
#
output:
  structure: directory
